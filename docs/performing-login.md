### Performing a user login in a computer at the ES4PS Domain

1. After restarting the computer (and completing the domain join process), you should see the user login screen.
    - Any user self-registered within the ES4PS platform can log in to the computer now.
2. A self-registered user can log in by clicking on "Other user" and typing the username and password.
    - For instance, the `es4psexampleuser` created in the **Registering a new user in the ES4PS platform** section can log in by typing `es4psexampleuser` in the username field and the password created in the registration process.
        - If you followed the password example in the registration process, the password should be `P@ssw0rdAB`.
3. After typing the username and password, click on the arrow or press Enter to log in.
4. After a few seconds (or SEVERAL minutes) the user will be greeted with a welcome message and the desktop will be shown.
    - With that step completed you can congratulate yourself for setting up the ES4PS platform that will help your organization to manage its users (and computers in future releases) in a clever way!
